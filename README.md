# Soon-to-be Refugee Information App
This webapp generates letters to congressmen based upon options that user select. The app then puts out a PDF of pre-addressed letters to senators. The letter content can be generic or customized to each senator. Regardless, all addresses and (if a call script is desired, telephone numbers) are automatically populated. All content can be edited by the user. Uses node.js on the client side to generate the PDF.

All data is pulled from Google Sheets.

This is based on the open source general version of the webapp at [app.scileadership.com](http://app.scileadership.com)
